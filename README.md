# BookReader
 
Personal project for training myself. I had to read a book but I really don't want to read it so I made a program that reads me.

# How To Install

```shell
$ git clone git://https://git.github.com/x.git
$ cd BookReader
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This repo requires Tkinter.

# Using Program

```shell
$ python main.py
```
